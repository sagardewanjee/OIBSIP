This GitHub repository pertains to my one-month internship in Data Analytics at Oasis Infobyte. Within this repository, I have documented a series of projects that I successfully undertook as part of my internship program. These tasks collectively represent my efforts and achievements throughout the duration of the internship.The projects was implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
<br />Project 1: The project involved cleaning and exploring a retail sales dataset, performing time series and customer demographic analysis using various plots. Key insights were drawn on sales trends, customer behavior, and correlations, with actionable recommendations provided to boost and stabilize sales.
<br />Project 2: The project involved cleaning and exploring customer data, handling outliers, and performing customer segmentation using K-means clustering. Key features like income, spending, and recency were used, and PCA was applied for visualization. Insights and recommendations were provided based on cluster characteristics.
<br />Project 3: The project focused on cleaning and standardizing a dataset with inconsistent and corrupted entries. Key steps included handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting negative and extreme values through outlier detection, and ensuring data integrity for reliable analysis.
